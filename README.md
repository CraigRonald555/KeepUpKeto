# KeepUpKeto

## Website

https://KeepUpKeto.com
  
The website essentially allows users to manage their ketogenic diet by offering them an interface to fill their weekly meal plan, automatically, based on their food preferences; or by searching for specific foods and finding recipes which include them. 

I managed to create multiple complex systems and combine them into a working system. My two proudest achievement were firstly, developing a system which broke down a user's daily nutritional requirements in order to fill their meal plan with meals suited to their favourite foods. My second proudest achievement was reducing data bandwidth & API calls by caching user data within their browser, and designing the system so it remained reliable and up-to-date across every device.
